The Jobs are scheduled over the weekend to ensure a crtical delivery on Monday , a war room is also in place to ensure smooth processing of the batch jobs.
More than 100 batch jobs are failing with the error ORA-01450 .
A bridge is opened and critical incident management team is made aware , as this is S1 issue impacting more than 1000 orders.
During the triage support team found that the values for customer name exceeded 4500 characters , which is allowed as per DB definition of the column .
Suppport team recreated the scenario in UAT and prepared an alter statement that modifies the column data type and fixes the existing prod issue and was successfully tested in UAT.
After taking all the required permissions from the call, the same alter statement has been executed in prod to prevent the batch failures .
A problem record has been opened by support team to tag all the relevenat scenarios from production. As a permanent fix , Dev team is planning to increase teh data type field length to 6000.
